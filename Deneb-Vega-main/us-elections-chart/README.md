# US Elections Chart

Interactive US Elections Chart

This is an idea I wanted to implement in Power BI long time ago, but the level of customization and interactivity I needed was not possible in Power BI at that time. It's possible now when Deneb custom visual allows us to embed Vega data visualizations into Power BI reports. I created this chart from a scratch. I have seen many differnet ways to visualize US presidential elections data, but nothing like this.

Basically ths chart contains 4 horizonatl bar charts combined together (inluding 2 stacked bar charts). Each bar chart has its own axis.
