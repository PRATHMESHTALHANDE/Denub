Data Visualizations Created Using Vega Visualization Grammar
This repository contains source code and data for data visualizations created by Andrzej Leszkiewicz using Vega visualization grammar. The visualizations presented here can be embedded into any Power BI report using the Deneb custom visual, as well as directly into any web page or app.

Each folder in this repository usually contains one visualization example: one Vega specification file (JSON) and at least one data file (CSV or JSON). Some examples may be presented in multiple variations and therefore have more than one Vega specification file per folder.
